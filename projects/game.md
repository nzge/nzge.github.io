# Concepts

Fighting game (either top-down, semi-3D like league)
- Unique character customization
  - each player gets a limited number of skill points
  - these skill points can be put into physical alterations to the character model. (longer arm, (maybe one arm longer one arm short), longer legs.)
  - can include weapons as well
  - the point is the game is supposed to be unserious, but still have engaging fighting mechanics. a perfect mix of whacky and serious (mechanically intense)
  - the end character model should look whacky/funny but be perfectly attuned to your playstyle.
