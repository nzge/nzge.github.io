**Client Objective**: Produce a geometrically faithful, functionally representative, and 3D printable CAD model of the most recent iteration of the O-Wind Turbine, originally developed by O-Inspiration as an award-winning urban wind energy solution. Based on available visual references and publicly accessible information.

## Build Log 

> 5-9-25: **Revision 1 complete**. Manufacturing optimizations. Created printable files for a full scale model and an approximate 1:10 scale-down of the intended 80cm diameter size (the side lengths of each triangle making up the tetrahedron panel are 80mm instead of 80cm) full scale model. The scale-down model is intended for print testing and prototyping before committing to a final version of the full scale model. Added a custom base fitted with bearings in the assembly for smooth operation.
