I have had this obsession for compact PC designs.
There is something about the fantasy of a tiny block of condensed compute that is capable of immense capability. The PC may never be the most optimal portable with the existence of the laptop or tablet, but there's some wierd satisfaction derived from the borderline portability of a PC.

This led me to chase the idea of creating my own compact PC case design to fulfill my personal needs.
