I first became an audiophile when I bought my first pair of IEMs freshman year of high school.
My parents had bought me the next gen iPod nano (which I ended using till sophomore year of uni), and I wanted to elevate my music experience. So I idiotically spent $300 on a pair of Westone UM1s. From then on I was hooked. I preceded to own the Status CB-1s, Koss PortaPro, Koss KPH40,Moondrop Starfield, and Etymotic Research ER2SE Studio Edition.
