&lt;p&gt;At heart, I am a romantic. Not in the colloquial sense, but more of a period sense, like the romantic period. There is a certain dreaminess and romance I choose to believe about the world.
I cannot live without it, even if it is a air of romance that I have fabricated in my mind. It exists to drive me and keep me same, to have a certain sense of hope for tomorrow, a greater tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>nzge</name></author><summary type="html">From this day forth, I declare myself a student of the world.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Design</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/05/01/Design.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Design" /><published>2025-05-01T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2025-05-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/05/01/Design</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/05/01/Design.html">&lt;p&gt;For most people, design is overlooked. 
But in fact, it shapes the world we live in. 
Design carries a utiliarian/functionalist aspect. But design even more importantly holds an aesthetic perspective/element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel as if design is so grossly underlooked. The way people have intentionally added curves and lines to a table, chair, house, desk, poster, whatever, fundamentally shapes the mental image of what that object should look like in our minds. Design is powerful in that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we ever stop to think about why do things look the way they do?
Someone took the time out of their day, month, year, and thought about these things. Toiled over it. Made it their life mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/!blog/chair.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woah. a chair.&lt;br /&gt;
The reason why we see chairs that look like this goddam everywhere, and why when we think of cheap plastic outdoor chair this image is seared into our mind is some absolute numbknuckle bozo (kidding actually quite brillaint) decided to recruit a few of his brain cells to conjure a nifty little concept of a stackable plastic chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is called the monobloc chair, a brilliant feat of engineering&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wooden veneer has become almost a cultural staple of the late 20th century to early 21st century aesthetic. There are these small yet resoundingly poignant details that shape the visual essence/depiction/image of the world we live in today. These small little aesthetic metas ideas that persist and propagate, covering the entire visual landscape of a nation or world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also just learned that Champion invented the hoodie. Pretty neat.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>nzge</name></author><summary type="html">For most people, design is overlooked.

&lt;p&gt;Does the Renaissance man spread their skill points across various talents/skills, instead of leveling and mastering one skill tree. Jack of all trades, master of none?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the Renaissance man have a place in the modern world? Does he hold relevancy? What is his role, or maybe is there one for him rather?&lt;/strong&gt; It seems more and more we are taught to pursue one thing only, put all our eggs in one basket. Let that one major you chooze on a whim in high school dictate the trajectory of your entire adult life. It could be a natural product of industrialization. We have becomes tiny ants in a larger colony network. We only need to take care of our own unique task, our own little cog in the greater engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one time, life was not so. Life persisted only on the condition that we have to tend to all our aspects of our life diligently. Not even talking from a survival perspective, tending to our food, our family, and building shelter, and such, is this true. Even as recent as the 1800s, our elected officials, the aristocratic, were not only politically inclined but students of science, math, and the arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might say that the traditional Japanese man is the antithesis of this philosophy. Shokunin 
Kishitsu, “the craftsman’s spirit.” A pursuit of perfection in one’s work, in one’s singular commitment to excellence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the allure of being a Renaissance man?&lt;/strong&gt;
One may say that the Renaissance philosophy is one that leaves no stone unturned. To pursue the betterment of oneself, and perhaps even the world at large, from a completely holistic perspective?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some problems are solved from a multidisciplinary perspective, recruiting an eclectic approach to reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am at a crossroads. Perfect one, or pursue many? This question may encapsulate a broader perspective of existence, but it is one I ask myself (either consciously or subconsciously) everyday. Should I be spending all my time learning one thing or doing one thing today, or have a balanced day various things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to choose? Life is so short, that maybe the question holds no value. Why even ask? Maybe just do. As cliche as it maybe, perhaps we must follow the heart, the gentle heart (find the kind heart within and listen, and not the violent heart).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>nzge</name></author><summary type="html">What does it mean to be a Renaissance man in 2025?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The seed</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/04/28/The-Seed.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The seed" /><published>2025-04-28T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2025-04-28T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/04/28/The%20Seed</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/04/28/The-Seed.html">&lt;p&gt;Why is the seed such a powerful metaphor?&lt;/p&gt;

Today I attempt to uncover that secret? That secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed that I like to put everything as a rhetorical, as an inquisition.
Maybe this is me placing a level of uncertainty on everything I understand about the world.
Or it’s a progressive belief that there is nuance to the world at every turn, and that there is more to be learned and nothing is fully answered. To open up the world to possibility and discovery is to the choice to live in a world of optimism. There is more to learn about the world, and thus life has meaning. 
There seems to be a correlation between true meaning in the world and the ability to inquire. Inquisition brings out meaning in the world. If there are more things to learn about that must mean there is meaning.
But why is that? Why is it that the perpetual search for understanding sparks a kind of significance to existence? Why is that what we don’t know brings a certain truth that there substance. Almost paradoxically, the absence of understanding brings about the presence of materiality/substance.
 When this concept is spoken, the idea resonates with me. But to fully understand why that is requires a deeper level of introspection that I am not certain I am capable of.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>nzge</name></author><summary type="html">Why do I frame everything in life as a question, and what does that say about who I am?

&lt;p&gt;It’s as if positivity and faith is wired into our neural circuitry, our behavorial/subsistence mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is obviously a clear distinction between thriving and survival. Caveman ape people of the past were certainly not koombayah-ing in the imminent threat of a bear mauling the entire village. But who really knows what they were really thinking. The evolutionary perspective that got them out of pure survival surely most have involved some kind of positive outlook, where positivity is defined by a long term belief that holistically, our day-to-day life follows an upward trajectory, maybe not by some quantifiable metric but in the general sense. The cavemen may not have been scientific thinkers measuring their progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption of a positive mindset is when we begin to live as beings on this earth.

&lt;p&gt;We often seek external sources of entertainment. We blast loud music to drown our thoughts. We play stupid videos, numbing our mind with out thumb in our mouth drool at the corner of our lips. If we took one step back, viewing ourself from the view of god, what would we think. This guy must be a retard I say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s because we are afraid to confront our thoughts. Too scared to discover what we have always feared. That what is inside is empty and boring. That deep down to the fiber of our being we are boring. We are solved, and there is nothing to discover. And that is a terrible revelation. It leads us into despair. We cannot bear to learn this truth, this governing maxim that clouds our existence, we are simply disinteresting at the core. That we are immaterial&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to learn to cultivate the seed of our natural born thought and intuition, that has always been there when we first came to exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why dreaming is so crucial&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is said (I don’t know who said it, maybe I said it). That when we are in a depressive state, we lose the ability to dream. A direct symptom of the sickness of the mind. From a scientific perspective dreaming indicates healthy neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we don’t see beyond what is physically in front of us we are a prison within ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
