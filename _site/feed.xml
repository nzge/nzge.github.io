&lt;p&gt;I noticed that I like to put everything as a rhetorical, as an inquisition.
Maybe this is me placing a level of uncertainty on everything I understand about the world.
Or it’s a progressive belief that there is nuance to the world at every turn, and that there is more to be learned and nothing is fully answered. To open up the world to possibility and discovery is to the choice to live in a world of optimism. There is more to learn about the world, and thus life has meaning. 
There seems to be a correlation between true meaning in the world and the ability to inquire. Inquisition brings out meaning in the world. If there are more things to learn about that must mean there is meaning.
But why is that? Why is it that the perpetual search for understanding sparks a kind of significance to existence? Why is that what we don’t know brings a certain truth that there substance. Almost paradoxically, the absence of understanding brings about the presence of materiality/substance.
 When this concept is spoken, the idea resonates with me. But to fully understand why that is requires a deeper level of introspection that I am not certain I am capable of.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>nzge</name></author><summary type="html">Why do I frame everything in life as a question, and what does that say about who I am?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Inspiration</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/04/15/Inspiration.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Inspiration" /><published>2025-04-15T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2025-04-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/04/15/Inspiration</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/04/15/Inspiration.html">&lt;p&gt;What inspires me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is inspiration? Is it what drives us in our day to day action?
Is it what gets us out of bed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind discipline (the moments where ) is there an underlying passion that drives our personal narrative. 
I have never found discipline to get me thorugh the day. If there is an action that I know to be good for me but I can’t convince myself on a spiritual level that it fundamentally contributes positively to who I am as a person, it is extremely hard for me to do it. I’m sure that isn’t an original thought. Maybe my understanding of discipline is completely miscontrued. 
But I always hear the most disciplined and successful people in the world, the David Goggins of the world, throw around the word/concept discipline as if this singular concept is what should drive us to perform the actions that we take. In my opinion the idea that that is what keeps us going is a bit reductive.
But at the same time, maybe life is not that complicated. We need simple words and concepts like “discipline” to drive us and push us. It is easy for our monkey brains to compute. A simple platitude to keep us from going insane.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>nzge</name></author><summary type="html">What inspires me?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Open source</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/04/10/Open-Source.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Open source" /><published>2025-04-10T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2025-04-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/04/10/Open%20Source</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/04/10/Open-Source.html">&lt;p&gt;We stand on the backs of giants. Or maybe one metaphorical giant rather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many current tools scrape/aggregate resources from across the web. Most egregious instances of this at the forefront of media are the various AI tools we use now on a daily basis.
Is this forgery/thievery or the next step in human evolution? That we as a singular race can levy the intellect of the entire human race, as one breathing unit? Open source on a global scale?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of open source as all-encompassing design/intellectual philosophy is one that favors an open collaboration with the world at large. An unselfish passing of information and material that doesn’t ask for any favors in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this promote homogeneity? The loss of self identity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is solipsism the antithesis of this ideology? 
Does there exist a leech that only takes from the world but does not give?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>nzge</name></author><summary type="html">We stand on the backs of giants.
