Extend the reality of being beyond the physical. 扩展我们的现实. Like terrain generation in Minecraft. Keep on walking outside what’s been generated



That is why dreaming is so crucial

It is said (I don’t know who said it, maybe I said it). That when we are in a depressive state, we lose the ability to dream. A direct symptom of the sickness of the mind. From a scientific perspective dreaming indicates healthy neural activity.

If we don’t see beyond what is physically in front of us we are a prison within ourselves.

There is merit to fantasy and the pragmatic. Fiction is spiritual. There is a reason beyond childlike wonder that we leave watching a Disney movie or Harry Potter with unequivocal sense of awe

We must read fiction and nonfiction.
