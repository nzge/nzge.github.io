The world is becoming more and more open source.
We stand on the backs of giants. Or maybe one metaphorical giant rather. Each brick is built upon a layer of bricks 

Modern computing is built off the critical of work of our prodigious forefathers, the ken thompsons and guidos of the world.

Many current tools scrape/aggregate resources from across the web. Most egregious instances of this at the forefront of media are the various AI tools we use now on a daily basis.
Is this forgery/thievery or the next step in human evolution? That we as a singular race can levy the intellect of the entire human race, as one breathing unit? Open source on a global scale?

The power of open source as all-encompassing design/intellectual philosophy is one that favors an open collaboration with the world at large. An unselfish passing of information and material that doesn't ask for any favors in return.

Does this promote homogeneity? The loss of self identity?

Is solipsism the antithesis of this ideology? 
Does there exist a leech that only takes from the world but does not give?
