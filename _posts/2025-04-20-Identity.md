Why is it that at the genesis of any creation, the creation retains individuality/identity. 

Humans feel the need to normalize, flatten, and smooth. Turn everything into plain white bread. The birth of the internet everyone had their own corner of the web. Webrings, geocities, personal flair. Your own corner of the internet is customized. 
In basketball, old school players had a set of skills that shaped their identity as a player. Modern NBA, everyone is slowly starting to become the same player. Everyone posseses the same bag of tricks.
The same phenomenon exists in social media. Things like myspace and old youtube pages allowed you to customize the look of your page. Nowaways customization is stripped, everything is clean, minimal. The absence of character is loud and apparent.

Individualism
If we remind ourselves, or think critically about the origin of thoughts, we come to the realization that thouughts are inspired/informed from external ideas and experiences. Where else can they be birthed? At least it's a huge part of where thoughts can come from, unless you believe in divine intervention.
If we pigeonhole ourselves to the same modelled path in the sense that we don't go out of our way to pursue unique experiences, or deviate beyond established structure (elementary -> middle -> high school -> uni.), we will slowly find ourselves thinking the same thoughts as everyone else, an echo chamber of sorts.
