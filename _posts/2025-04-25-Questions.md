Why do I frame everything in life as a question, and what does that say about who I am?
Today I attempt to uncover that secret? That secret.

I noticed that I like to put everything as a rhetorical, as an inquisition.
Maybe this is me placing a level of uncertainty on everything I understand about the world.
Or it's a progressive belief that there is nuance to the world at every turn, and that there is more to be learned and nothing is fully answered. To open up the world to possibility and discovery is to the choice to live in a world of optimism. There is more to learn about the world, and thus life has meaning. 
There seems to be a correlation between true meaning in the world and the ability to inquire. Inquisition brings out meaning in the world. If there are more things to learn about that must mean there is meaning.
But why is that? Why is it that the perpetual search for understanding sparks a kind of significance to existence? Why is that what we don't know brings a certain truth that there substance. Almost paradoxically, the absence of understanding brings about the presence of materiality/substance.
 When this concept is spoken, the idea resonates with me. But to fully understand why that is requires a deeper level of introspection that I am not certain I am capable of.
