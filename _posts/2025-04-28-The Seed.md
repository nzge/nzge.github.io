Why is the seed such a powerful metaphor?

The seed implies a certain stored potential/dynamicism. Something ready to burst.
It implies the birth of something, anything. 

To trace the origin, to know what lies at the start of it all

What is our fascination with reaction, and sequence. To truly pinpoint how or why, the order of being. But most crucially, the acquiescence, the mother of being 

Baked into the definition/the core programming of the seed, is improbability. The terrifying beauty of uncertainty. What becomes of the seed, when it sprouts its germ?

Seed, root, at the center, the start of the something. A seed, from which something blossoms. Seed of destruction, or the seed of a metaphorical flower
