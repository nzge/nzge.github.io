The internet is my greatest teacher and mentor. Yes. Not any one teacher in elementary, middle, or high school. It certainly wasn't Mr. Niebaum (Knee Bomb, we liked to call him). Not any teacher in Chinese after school, or professor in uni. Any one adult/parent, mentor, or "guru". Not even my parents.

As sad as that may be, it's true.
The breadth and depth of knowledge that the internet has provided to me has been insurmountable.
Not even from a mouthbreather neckbeard terminally online kind of perspective.

Maybe to reduce the internet down to this one entity this one word, is a little disingenuous. It diminishes the true nature of what it really is.
The internet encapsulates the thoughts and ideas of millions if not billions of people. As a hive mind, it captures the ideas of many and crumples it down to this one surfable space of infinite wisdom. Beautiful, isn't it?
