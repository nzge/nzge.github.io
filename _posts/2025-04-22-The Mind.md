Fraternize with your mind, your eternal companion. Be your own amusement. Be you own jester. 

We often seek external sources of entertainment. We blast loud music to drown our thoughts. We play stupid videos, numbing our mind with out thumb in our mouth drool at the corner of our lips. If we took one step back, viewing ourself from the view of god, what would we think. This guy must be a retard I say

Itâ€™s because we are afraid to confront our thoughts. Too scared to discover what we have always feared. That what is inside is empty and boring. That deep down to the fiber of our being we are boring. We are solved, and there is nothing to discover. And that is a terrible revelation. It leads us into despair. We cannot bear to learn this truth, this governing maxim that clouds our existence, we are simply disinteresting at the core. That we are immaterial

We need to learn to cultivate the seed of our natural born thought and intuition, that has always been there when we first came to exist. 

Maybe the root of our sorrows stems from the cesspool of garbage we flood and drown our minds in. The endless doom scroll
