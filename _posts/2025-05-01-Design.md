For most people, design is overlooked. 
But in fact, it shapes the world we live in. 
Design carries a utiliarian/functionalist aspect. But design even more importantly holds an aesthetic perspective/element. 

I feel as if design is so grossly underlooked. The way people have intentionally added curves and lines to a table, chair, house, desk, poster, whatever, fundamentally shapes the mental image of what that object should look like in our minds. Design is powerful in that way. 

Do we ever stop to think about why do things look the way they do?
Someone took the time out of their day, month, year, and thought about these things. Toiled over it. Made it their life mission.

Woah. a chair.  
The reason why we see chairs that look like this goddam everywhere, and why when we think of cheap plastic outdoor chair this image is seared into our mind is some absolute numbknuckle bozo (kidding actually quite brillaint) decided to recruit a few of his brain cells to conjure a nifty little concept of a stackable plastic chair.

It is called the monobloc chair, a brilliant feat of engineering



The wooden veneer has become almost a cultural staple of the late 20th century to early 21st century aesthetic. There are these small yet resoundingly poignant details that shape the visual essence/depiction/image of the world we live in today. These small little aesthetic metas ideas that persist and propagate, covering the entire visual landscape of a nation or world.
