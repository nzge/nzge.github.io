Having a positive outlook on any given situation is the only way to persist. It is the utilitarian approach.

It's as if positivity and faith is wired into our neural circuitry, our behavorial/subsistence mechanisms.

There is obviously a clear distinction between thriving and survival. Caveman ape people of the past were certainly not koombayah-ing in the imminent threat of a bear mauling the entire village. But who really knows what they were really thinking. The evolutionary perspective that got them out of pure survival surely most have involved some kind of positive outlook, where positivity is defined by a long term belief that holistically, our day-to-day life follows an upward trajectory, maybe not by some quantifiable metric but in the general sense. The cavemen may not have been scientific thinkers measuring their progress.

The adoption of a positive mindset is when we begin to live as beings on this earth.
To be a cynic as the core is to claim defeat at the foot of death. A surrendering of our being. 


People conflate hesitancy and cynicism with intelligence and measuredness, when it could not be more far from the truth. The greatest minds are dreamers and believers. True and pure ideas are birthed from optimism and thinking with faith, and a level of optimism potentially overbearing.
