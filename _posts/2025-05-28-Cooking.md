Mastering cooking is a lesson on anti-materialistic mindsets. Loosening your attachments to wordly possessions. Each recipe and artfully crafted dish enters the mouth and dissapears. Yet we hold no sense of yearning/attachment to the food we consume.
We spend so much effort to make the dish great, but the experience is fleeting. 

I guess for most day-to-day cooking is more of a utility than an art. Even so, food is universally a source of enjoyment and most of us strive to improve our eating experience in any capacity.
