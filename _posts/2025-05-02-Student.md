From this day forth, I declare myself a student of the world.

At heart, I am a romantic. Not in the colloquial sense, but more of a period sense, like the romantic period. There is a certain dreaminess and romance I choose to believe about the world.
I cannot live without it, even if it is a air of romance that I have fabricated in my mind. It exists to drive me and keep me same, to have a certain sense of hope for tomorrow, a greater tomorrow.
