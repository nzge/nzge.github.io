Why is it that at the genesis of any creation, the creation retains individuality/identity. 


Humans feel the need to normalize, flatten, and smooth. Turn everything into plain white bread. The birth of the internet everyone had their own corner of the web. Webrings, geocities, personal flair. Your own corner of the internet is customized. 
In basketball, old school players had a set of skills that shaped their identity as a player. Modern NBA, everyone is slowly starting to become the same player. Everyone posseses the same bag of tricks.
The same phenomenon exists in social media. Things like myspace and old youtube pages allowed you to customize the look of your page. Nowaways customization is stripped, everything is clean, minimal. The absence of character is loud and apparent.
