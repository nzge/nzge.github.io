Normalize uniqueness. Normalize doing things nobody has done, or doing things that you do not because you've seen someone else do them.

We often seek a model/blueprint for action. That is what inhibits our natural potential. 
I look on social media, and sometimes feels like I'm looking into a sea of mindless pigs. Not quirky or interesting. We impress on ourselves a vision of social normality to not step out of place, under the notion that anything outside the norm is peculiar.

Break the mold. Unironically we need to escape the matrix. Not in a alpha male Andrew Tate way, but trust our unique creative inhibitions to do things that ignite the human soul. This thought comes fresh off of listening to the riveting tales of Tim Sweeney, founder of Epic games and creator of Unreal engine. In the early days of the internet, it felt like every project became a breakthrough, because it was, and it had to be. Boundaries were pushed and new territory explored. It was normal. The passion from these developers was fueled by a lack of inhibition, to explore ideas coming purely from the mind unperturbed by what others may think. x
