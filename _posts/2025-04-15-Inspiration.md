What inspires me? 

What is inspiration? Is it what drives us in our day to day action?
Is it what gets us out of bed?

Behind discipline (the moments where ) is there an underlying passion that drives our personal narrative. 
I have never found discipline to get me thorugh the day. If there is an action that I know to be good for me but I can't convince myself on a spiritual level that it fundamentally contributes positively to who I am as a person, it is extremely hard for me to do it. I'm sure that isn't an original thought. Maybe my understanding of discipline is completely miscontrued. 
But I always hear the most disciplined and successful people in the world, the David Goggins of the world, throw around the word/concept discipline as if this singular concept is what should drive us to perform the actions that we take. In my opinion the idea that that is what keeps us going is a bit reductive.
But at the same time, maybe life is not that complicated. We need simple words and concepts like "discipline" to drive us and push us. It is easy for our monkey brains to compute. A simple platitude to keep us from going insane.
