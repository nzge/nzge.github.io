                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">In the grand tapestry of human existence, the threads of knowledge weave a complex narrative that transcends time and space. From the ancient scrolls of antiquity to the digital archives of the present, humanity's quest for understanding has illuminated the darkest corners of ignorance. Yet, amidst the vast expanse of wisdom, we remain but humble stewards of knowledge, tasked with preserving its sanctity for generations yet unborn. Let us cherish the pursuit of truth as our noble endeavor, for in the tapestry of human existence, it is our relentless curiosity that binds us together, weaving the fabric of civilization itself."</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">As the neurons of our collective consciousness fire in intricate patterns, we dance upon the stage of intellectual inquiry. Each thought, a brushstroke upon the canvas of human understanding, contributes to the masterpiece of enlightenment. From the whispered secrets of the cosmos to the whispered secrets of the human heart, we are but explorers in the labyrinth of knowledge, forever seeking the elusive truth that lies just beyond our grasp.</p>

# Kelvin Helmholtz Instability

Kelvinâ€“Helmholtz instability with a discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method on a hierarchical Cartesian mesh with ADR


```js
console.log('hello world!');
```

 
Make sure:
- You're specifying the correct language (`js` for JavaScript, `cpp` for C++, etc.).
- There are no missing backticks.

## **Use a Dark-Themed Code Block Style**  
If you want the dark background with colorful syntax like in the image, you need a CSS file that styles your code blocks.  

For a **Jekyll site**, add this to your CSS (`assets/css/style.css` or another stylesheet):  

```css
pre, code {
    background-color: #282c34; /* Dark background */
    color: #abb2bf; /* Light gray text */
    font-family: 'Fira Code', monospace; /* Monospaced font */
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    display: block;
    overflow-x: auto;
}

.token.keyword { color: #c678dd; } /* Purple */
.token.string { color: #98c379; } /* Green */
.token.function { color: #61afef; } /* Blue */
```

You can customize the colors based on your preferred syntax theme (e.g., **Monokai, Dracula, One Dark**).  

If using **Markdown in VS Code or GitHub**, you may not have full control over styling, but VS Code uses its built-in themes.  

Let me know if you're using a specific platform, and I can tailor the solution! ðŸš€


This is inline math: \(E = mc^2\)

This is a block equation:  
$$ \int_0^1 x^2 \,dx $$

Euler's formula: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$
